Work in progress audio project

Currently allows for users to record/import their own audio files and visualize them
using spectrograms, waveforms, and chromagrams by turning them into their own
'WaveObjects'.
Also equipped with a stereo to mono audio file function that are required for some of the plots.

The spectrogram function was inspired and heavily based on https://github.com/musikalkemist/AudioSignalProcessingForML
Uses Short-Time Fourier Transform to do so.

Currently WaveObjects require a pitch to be constructed this is to help analyze the sound and
plot only a few waveforms of the object for convenience of the user.

Chromagram plotter is taken from librosa library.

Long term goal is to be able to take clean audio samples of instruments
in order to compare them with pre-existing samples and try and reach a 
desired timbre/tone by giving tips and hints based off the audio analysis
of the audio. Preferably in a real-time context.
